IEEE802.1 Bridging - LAN/MAN bridging and management.
                     Covers management and the lower sub-layers of OSI layer
                     2, including MAC based briding virtual LANs and port-based
                     access control

IEEE802.3 Ethernet - Provides asynchronous networking using CSMA/CD
                     Carrier sense multiple access with collision detect.
                     Over coax, twisted-pair copper, and optical fiber media.
                     Current speeds range from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps.

IEEE802.11 Wifi - Wireless LAN Media Access Control 
                  Layers 1(Physical) & 2(MAC address)

IEEE802.15 Wireless PAN - Bluetooth, UWB, ZigBee, Mesh Networks
                          UWB electronics are hard to make but secure
                          Zigbee - collect info from multiple sensors
                          1 hop to transmit. Adopted by Hydro companies.
                          Mesh Networks spreads network without increasing 
                          power. Good application for agriulture. Improved
                          version of ZigBee.
