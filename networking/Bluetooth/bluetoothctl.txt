Process for interacting with bluetoothctl/bluetoothd

You can check the status of bluetoothd by running:
  $ systemctl status bluetooth

If it is not enabled, enable the daemon by runnin:
  $ sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
  $ sudo systemctl restart bluetooth

  Or
  $ sudo systemctl re-enable bluetooth

Reminder that enable means the service will start on boot.
While start will simply start the service.
To just start bluetoothd run:
  $ sudo systemctl start bluetooth


To connect with a wireless device like a speaker or headphones

  1. Run the command $ bluetoothctl
    
    A prompt will show up that looks like:
      [bluetooth]# 
    
    Above the prompt it might display devices you have connected with.

  2. Then power on the bluetooth controller
  
    [bluetooth]# power on

    The output should say: Changing power on succeeded

  3. Then scan for the device
    
    [bluetooth]# scan on

  4. Find your device in the list of available devices then trust the device

    [bluetooth]# trust 84:AD:8D:46:3B:94
    Changing 84:AD:8D:46:3B:94 trust succeeded

      in the bluetoothctl CLI interactive mode
    
    Solution
      $ rfkill block bluetooth

      This enables bluetooth
