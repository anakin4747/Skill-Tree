To install wpa_supplicant you need to run

    $ apt-get install wpasupplicant

You likely wont need to install it as it should be already downloaded on linux
systems

Note that there is no underscore in the package you would install

In the location /etc/network/interfaces.d/ there are files matching each
network connection which lists the settings of that interface.

Note that on ubuntu there is no interfaces.d but instead 4 configuration
directory files:

    if-down.d
    if-post-down.d
    if-pre-up.d
    if-up.d

On the raspberry pi there is an interfaces.d configuration directory
