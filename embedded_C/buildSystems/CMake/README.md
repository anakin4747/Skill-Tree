I am new to CMake lists but have watched some tutorials on cmake.

I understand its purpose is for portability and that it generates the makefile.

I have used them for programming a raspberry pi pico through the C/C++ SDK. It
requires cmake knowledge so I learnt it for my Capstone project at Western.
