# Learning C with The C Programming Textbook by K & R

I wanted to learn C and UNIX for embedded design, so I decided to go through "The C Programming Textbook" by K & R. These are my versions of the exercises and examples thoughout the textbook.

I was not able to finish every exercise as my co-op finished and school became
the top priority again.
