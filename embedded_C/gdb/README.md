I have spent quite a bit of time working in gdb.

I was trying to fully immerse myself in all things command line.

This meant switching from VS code to vim.
From an IDE debugger to gdb.

I am familiar with the most common gdb commands, I even use it regularly to debug
an RP2040 for personal projects.
I am comfortable going back and forth from the command line gdb to the tui
interface.
