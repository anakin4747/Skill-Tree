Hello Future Employers.

I am Anakin Childerhose and I have made this filesystem/skilltree to emphasize
what skills I have learnt and some skills I want to learn.

I have organized the skill tree so that I can show off some skills that would
be valuable to the embedded RTOS and Network Engineering domains.

Folders which are visible either have sample code or text documents with some
comments of my knowledge in those areas.

If a folder is visible but empty that means I have yet to fill that section out
as this is a work in progress that I will be perfecting for years to come.

I very much value continuous self improvement so most of the concepts/skills
I have learnt here are skills I have learnt on my own in my freetime, and I will
be continuing to expand this skill tree as my skills grow.
