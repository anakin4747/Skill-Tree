Globbing

Global patterns that specifies sets of filenames with wildcard characters.

Its just using * and ? to describe target files.

like 

$ rm *.txt

The * wildcard will mean anything. So this will remove anything ending with
.txt.

and

$ rm file?.txt

The ? wildcard will mean any single character. So this will remove file1.txt
but not file11.txt.

You can also use some regex patterns like []. But regex and file globbing are
completely different. Globbing is just for filenames. Regex are just patterns
in text. There is a lot more syntax in regex.

$ rm [bc]at.txt

This will remove the files bat.txt and cat.txt but not rat.txt.

$ rm [2-9][a-c].txt

You can also specify ranges by using a - inside the []. This will remove files
like 3b.txt or 9a.txt but not 3d.txt or 1a.txt. The range is only for the
single character.

$ rm [!2-9].txt

You can also use ! to negate a match. So this will work for 1.txt and 0.txt
only.
