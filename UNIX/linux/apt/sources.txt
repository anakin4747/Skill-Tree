To understand where apt looks for packages we will look into the list of
sources

The list of sources can be found in /etc/apt/sources.list

Below we see a portion of the file, # indicate comments 

....

# See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to
# newer versions of the distribution.
deb http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jammy main restricted
# deb-src http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jammy main restricted

....

The uncommented portions follow the format of:

typeOfPackages repoURL distroReleaseCodeName repoType

So in my sources.list I have:

deb - for the type of package
    deb-src is also common and are source files compared to compiled deb files

http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ - for the repo's URL

jammy - for the distro's release code name
    jammy is for jammy jellyfish
    Other common ones are xenial, bionic, and focal for ubuntu
        or buster or sid for debian

main and restricted - for the types of repo's that apt will reference
    Some other options are universal and multiverse

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Typically its not safe to edit the file yourself it is best to use the command
add-apt-repository. Which will keep you from breaking apt.
