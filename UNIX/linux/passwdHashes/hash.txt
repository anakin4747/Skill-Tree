Hashes in depth

Example Hash:

    $6$KHBKjvhjlbKBJDLN.....$JBHFkdbskOIHOkjbBKjbKJBKJ....

Note that this may not be an accurate hash as I just keymashed to simulate one.

The first field is the Hash type. This specifies the algorith used to create
the hash. Below are some common Hash types.

    $1$ - MD5
    $2a$ - Blowfish
    $2y$ - Blowfish
    $5$ - SHA-256
    $6$ - SHA-512   - This is the default in red-hat enterprise linux

The second field is the Salt. Is a bit of extra protect to make the hash
stronger. The salt gets added to the password in the hashing function to make
the hash unique. So if 2 users had the same password, without salt they would
have the same hash, but salt makes the hashes different. Prevents attacks such
as rainbow table. Its an attack that has several hashes already computed and
just compares that to get the password. With the salt this is no longer
possible to do. The salt is always randomly generated.

The last field is the actual hash.

Also something worth noting is that if you run the command usermod --lock to
lock a user out of their account, an ! is added at the beginning of the whole
hash. usermod --unlock just removes the !. The ! renders the hash unusable and
therefor preventing the user from logging in.
