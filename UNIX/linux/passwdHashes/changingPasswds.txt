To securely change passwords within a script

Use the chpasswd -e command. The -e flag means you will be passing in a hashed
password. This prevents you from having cleartext passwords in your scripts.

Example:

$ python3

>>> import crypt; print(crypt.crypt('Colorado'))
$6$h0jd.smcwHgRsbPB$TEYd8Rzlzlm1YoLtsCy6Zohwvg9QsxKFVDjsMSLEM67kAq0yL4Aw.JYE0BgJG0paxpwZablWtZZOApxvBj3dr.
>>>^D

$ echo
'userID:$6$h0jd.smcwHgRsbPB$TEYd8Rzlzlm1YoLtsCy6Zohwvg9QsxKFVDjsMSLEM67kAq0yL4Aw.JYE0BgJG0paxpwZablWtZZOApxvBj3dr.'
| chpasswd -e

Thats all supposed to be 1 line.

But what that does is: first you generate a hash using python3 then exit
python3. Then you echo the targets user id and the hash separated by a : and
pipe the text into chpasswd -e.

Sudo will likely be required if you are not root.
